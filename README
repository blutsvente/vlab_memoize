A Specman/e package that provides a memoization utility for methods.

Given a pure method definition, e.g. 
	  foo(a: uint): int { ... }
you can memoize it at the place of its definition by 
	MEMOIZE foo(a: uint): int { ... }
 
See also examples/test_memoize.e. You can also run demo.sh (might need adjustment to work with your Specman installation).
